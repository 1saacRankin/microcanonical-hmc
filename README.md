The project directory is organized as:  
* [/code](https://github.com/1saacRankin/microcanonical-hmc) for the code to run experiments for the small project.  
* [/plots](https://github.com/1saacRankin/microcanonical-hmc) for the plots for the report.  
* [/report](https://github.com/1saacRankin/microcanonical-hmc) for the files to produce the report.


### The project will compare sequential and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning and benchmark against NUTS.
