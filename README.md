# Comparing Metropolis Adjusted Microcanonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to the No-U-Turn Sampler

Qualifying paper #2 with Trevor Campbell:
[Metropolis Adjusted Microcanonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01707) by Jakob Robnik, Reuben Cohn-Gordon, and Uroš Seljak.



## The project will compare sequential and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning and benchmark against NUTS.
